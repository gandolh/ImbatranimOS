/**
 * Server-backed dotfiles, with a local mirror for the first paint (brief 49).
 *
 * ## Why not server-only, as the brief says
 *
 * The brief says to replace each store's `persist(localStorage)` with a
 * server-backed adapter. For three of the four stores that is exactly right. For
 * **appearance it cannot be**, and the reason is structural rather than a
 * preference: `main.tsx` applies the theme and accent *synchronously, before
 * React mounts*, so that the very first paint — the lock screen — is branded.
 * That paint happens **before the user has authenticated**, and `/api/prefs` is
 * behind the session guard, as it must be. There is no server to read at the
 * moment the value is needed.
 *
 * So the model is **server as source of truth, localStorage as a first-paint
 * cache**: paint immediately from the cache, hydrate from the server once
 * authenticated, re-apply if they differ, and keep the cache updated. A browser
 * that has never seen this machine paints the default behind the lock and picks
 * up the real values on sign-in, which is correct — your wallpaper lives behind
 * your password.
 *
 * The cache is also what makes the write path cheap: a change updates memory and
 * localStorage at once, and the server write is debounced behind it.

 * Keys that live on the server. Anything not in here is not a dotfile.
 *
 * Adding a store to this list is **not optional bookkeeping** — `writePref`
 * silently drops anything absent, so a store wired to `prefsStorage` without an
 * entry here persists to localStorage only and looks like it works right up
 * until you sign in from a second browser. Brief 81's file associations shipped
 * that way for exactly as long as it took to check the server copy.
