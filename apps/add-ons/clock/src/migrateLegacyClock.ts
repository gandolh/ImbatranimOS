 * Now they live in the container. A silent switch would read as data loss to
 * anyone who has been using it, so on first load the old state is handed over —
 * and the user is told it happened.
 *
 * Exactly-once is enforced on the server (it refuses to import into a non-empty
 * table), not by a flag here: two tabs opening at the same moment would both find
 * the same key.

 * already had clock data, this browser's copy is left alone rather than thrown
 * away, because it may be the only copy of alarms set on a *different* machine.
