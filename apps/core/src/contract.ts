 * draws the frame), be cheap, poll in seconds not frames, and hold no

   * - It is mounted once, always, whether or not the app's window is open — that

   *   to draw.
   * - Its wrapper is `pointer-events-none`, so the layer never swallows a click
   *   meant for the wallpaper or an icon. Anything interactive inside it must opt
   *   back in with `pointer-events-auto` on its own element.
   * - It sits **above** the icon grid, because the icon container spans the whole
   *   desktop and would otherwise intercept every click aimed at the layer. Draw
   *   only where the user has actually put something.

   * The seam exists so Clock alarms, Calendar reminders and Todo due dates can
   * fire without their windows being open — the three apps used to apologise

   *
   * - It renders nothing (`return null`); it exists for effects.
   * - It must be cheap: one slow interval, no per-frame work, no WebSockets.
   * - Anything user-visible it produces goes through `notify(...)`, and any
   *   occurrence-shaped notification must be claimed first (see
   *   `claimScheduleOccurrence`) so a second desktop tab does not double-toast.
