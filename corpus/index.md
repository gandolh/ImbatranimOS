## Wiki

- [architecture](wiki/architecture.md) — Web-OS era stack — Alpine + NestJS container, one authed port, React/Vite desktop split into @imbatranim/core + add-on packages (npm workspaces + turbo), PTY/FS/monitor apps, volume-backed home.
- [decisions](wiki/decisions.md) — Locked choices of the web-OS era (2026-07-16 pivot grilling) plus the 2026-07-17 office-suite/post-v1 set, the 2026-07-18 REST-client SSRF stance, and a compressed record of the superseded ISO-era decisions — do not relitigate without an explicit revisit and a log entry.
- [open-questions](wiki/open-questions.md) — Web-OS era unknowns — app-install story without sudo, HTTPS in-app vs proxy, accent pick, image size reality, registry publishing, fork prune surprises.
- [os-layering](wiki/os-layering.md) — The OS-as-layers design (2026-07-19 grilling) — three layers (kernel/userland ↔ compositor/display ↔ apps), an injected `system` capability handle as the app↔OS protocol seam, the `@imbatranim/ui`-library vs capabilities bisection, and the kill-list of real-Linux daemons we deliberately do NOT build.
- [overview](wiki/overview.md) — What ImbatranimOS is after the 2026-07-16 pivot — a real Alpine container whose desktop is a React web app — plus the project's lineage and audience.
- [status](wiki/status.md) — Dated snapshot — web-OS era; briefs 08–14 + 16–46 DONE. The 2026-07-18 full-auto daily-driver backlog (34–46) is COMPLETE: CORE notification center (34), Wave C's six light apps (35–40), Wave D's four heavy/backend apps (41–44: Monaco code-editor + git-gui + REST client + archive-manager, the backend three authed+jailed, adversarially security-reviewed + hardened), and Wave E's two CORE platform surfaces (45 global search launcher, 46 add-on manager). Desktop = 23 apps; 135 backend tests. Only human-gated items remain before v1.0: SEC-9 CSP + SEC-10 kiosk sandbox (browser/ISO-gated), brief 15's v1-release remainder, and per-brief human walkthroughs.
