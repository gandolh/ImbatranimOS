/**
 * Durable user config — the dotfiles half of brief 49's split.
 *
 * The layering grill settled the model as SSH: a **session** is per-tab and dies
 * with the tab, while **user config** belongs to the account and follows you to
 * any browser, the way `.bashrc` follows you to any login. Wallpaper, accent,
 * icon positions and the disabled-app set were in `localStorage`, which is
 * neither — tied to one browser, lost on a different device or cleared storage,
 * and shared between tabs that should not share anything.
 *
 * **The value is opaque here on purpose.** The server stores whatever JSON a
 * store hands it and never parses or validates the shape. Giving the backend a
 * schema for every client store would mean a backend change every time a store
 * gains a field, and a version skew bug the first time the two disagreed. The
 * client owns the meaning; this owns durability and access control.
