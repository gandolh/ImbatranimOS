/**
 * Containment for a single window's app content (brief 47).
 *
 * Every windowed app renders into core's shared React tree, so one uncaught
 * `throw` in a render or effect unmounts **the whole desktop** — React's default
 * behaviour is all that stands between a buggy app and a blank screen. Apps here
 * are first-party and built in, so the threat is a *buggy* app rather than a
 * malicious one, and a boundary addresses that completely at no API cost.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - **It does not wrap the window chrome.** The boundary sits inside the frame,
 *   so a crashed app can still be dragged, focused, resized and closed. Putting
 *   the chrome inside would mean a crash takes away the very controls needed to
 *   deal with it.
 * - **It does not catch a hang.** An error boundary catches throws, not infinite
 *   loops, and a spinning app still freezes the tab because every app shares the
 *   main thread. Real hang isolation needs the iframe/worker transport that
 *   brief 48's seam makes possible; a watchdog here would be a worse version of
 *   it. The limit is documented rather than half-solved.
