# Status — 2026-07-17

**Phase: building.** The project is a web-OS: real Alpine container, React
desktop as its screen (see [decisions.md](decisions.md)). Briefs 08 + 09
landed — the fork is imported/pruned and the dual-mode container image
builds and runs (desktop + API on one port, unprivileged imbatranim user,
volume-persisted home). Committed to `main` (local-only, no PR/CI).

## Metrics (recorded)

- Prod image size: **382 MB** (2026-07-17, brief 15 verify build — was 364
  before auth/argon2 + system apps; target ≤~400 ✓). See
  [decisions.md](decisions.md).
- Cold start: **1.42 s** (container start → first HTTP 200 on /health,
  fresh volume incl. migration). Idle RAM: **41.3 MiB** (docker stats
  after 60 s). The "lightweight" receipts, 2026-07-17.

## Briefs

| # | Brief | State | One-liner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01–07 | ISO era | superseded | Full installable-distro path; record in briefs/superseded/ + log |
| 08 | [fork-bootstrap](../briefs/done/08-fork-bootstrap.md) | **done** | Imported + pruned minimal-web-desktop; dev loop verified |
| 09 | [container-image](../briefs/done/09-container-image.md) | **done** | Dual-mode Dockerfile; one port, imbatranim user, volume home verified; image 364MB (over target — revisit flagged) |
| 10 | [auth](../briefs/done/10-auth.md) | **done** | Sessions (argon2id + httpOnly cookie), first-run wizard, optional TOTP, login throttle, global guard + WS validator; HTTPS = Caddy reverse proxy (decided) |
| 11 | [terminal-app](../briefs/done/11-terminal-app.md) | **done** | Real WS PTY at /api/pty (auth on upgrade, backpressure, revocation sweep); old repl module deleted; multi-instance Terminal app |
| 12 | [files-app](../briefs/done/12-files-app.md) | **done** | Home-root FS API (traversal/symlink jail, tested) + explorer UI with tree/context menu/upload/download |
| 13 | [system-monitor](../briefs/done/13-system-monitor.md) | **done** | Live CPU/RAM/disk/processes + About; uid-scoped kill; app-install stance recorded |
| 14 | [imbatranim-reskin](../briefs/done/14-imbatranim-reskin.md) | **done** | Win7-classic taskbar/start/tray/icons, B&W tokens, dark default, hourglass logo; accent = 4 presets, crimson provisional (user pick pending) |
| 15 | [v1-release](../briefs/todo/15-v1-release.md) | in progress | Engineering DONE (security pass, 413/headers/repl_configs fixes, README, 1.0.0 stamp, container verified + numbers); human-gated remainder: friend QA, VPS deploy, accent pick, dep bumps, tag |
| 16 | [turborepo](../briefs/todo/16-turborepo.md) | todo | npm workspaces + turbo; grilled 2026-07-16, spec complete + build-ready; phantom tailwind deps rehomed as part of it |
| 17 | [os-restructure](../briefs/todo/17-os-restructure.md) | todo | apps/{backend,core,add-ons/*} split; grilled 2026-07-16, build-ready; package-per-add-on, core=Vite host+manifest, lands AFTER 16 |

Dependency order: 08 ✓ → 09 ✓ → 10 ✓ → {11 ✓, 12 ✓, 13 ✓} → 14 → 15.
Briefs 16/17 (turborepo, restructure) are parked outside this chain —
16 grilled/deferred, 17 ungrilled.

## Where things stand

Engineering for v1.0 is COMPLETE: auth (10), terminal (11), files (12),
monitor (13), reskin (14), and brief 15's hardening slice — 73 unit + 29
e2e backend tests green, prod container verified for real (argon2-on-
Alpine confirmed, full auth flow over curl, 382 MB / 1.42 s / 41 MiB).
Remaining before the v1.0 tag, all human-gated: friend-run QA on a clean
machine, one VPS+HTTPS deploy per the Caddy recipe, the accent final pick
(crimson is provisional), and the recommended dep bumps
(@nestjs/platform-express for multer, axios) + npm audit fix.
