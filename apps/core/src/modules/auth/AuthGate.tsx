/**
 * Gates the entire desktop, in two regimes (brief 101):
 *
 * **Before this tab's first login** it behaves as it always has — only the
 * first-run wizard or the full-screen lock exists; nothing desktop-shaped
 * mounts or fetches.
 *
 * **After** (`everAuthenticated`), locking and session loss become an OPAQUE
 * OVERLAY over the still-mounted desktop instead of a teardown. That is the
 * whole point: unmounting closed the Terminal's socket (the backend kills the
 * pty on close), discarded every dirty editor buffer, and reset every window's
 * state — fifteen idle minutes cost real work. The tree beneath the overlay is
 * `visibility:hidden` + `inert` + `aria-hidden`, so nothing paints, nothing
 * focuses, and a screen reader cannot walk it; the keyboard chokepoints gate on
 * `isShellSuspended()` besides. Explicit sign-out still tears everything down —
 * walking away on purpose means the screen owes you nothing.
 *
 * It is also where the dotfiles are hydrated (brief 49): `/api/prefs` is behind
 * the session guard, so the transition into `authenticated` is the one moment
 * hydration is both necessary and possible.
