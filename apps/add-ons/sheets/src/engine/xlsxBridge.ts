/**
 * Lazy bridge between xlsx bytes and Univer's workbook model, backed by
 * **ExcelJS** (MIT). The entire ExcelJS round-trip — load + cell→Univer mapping
 * on parse, Univer→cell + writeBuffer on serialize — runs in a dedicated Web
 * Worker (`./xlsxWorker.ts`), so the CPU-bound per-cell iteration never blocks
 * the desktop's UI thread. Because the worker is the only thing that imports
 * ExcelJS, the heavy `exceljs` chunk lands entirely in the worker chunk and
 * never in the desktop boot bundle or the main sheets entry chunk. The worker
 * is created lazily on first open/save (same as the old dynamic import) and
 * reused across every subsequent open/save.
 *
 * SheetJS Community Edition was the original pick but its writer silently drops
 * cell styles (bold/fills/colors) — proven in the brief-20 spike — so it fails
 * the "basic styles survive open→edit→save" bar. ExcelJS reads *and* writes
 * fonts, fills, number formats and formulas, which the spike verified via an
 * independent openpyxl round-trip. This bridge maps the intersection Univer can
 * render: values, formulas, number formats, bold/italic, font color, and solid
 * cell fills. The mapping code itself lives in the worker (moved verbatim, not
 * rewritten) so fidelity is unchanged — this module only owns the threading.
